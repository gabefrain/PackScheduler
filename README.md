# PackScheduler

This is a project I am currently doing in my Software Development Fundamentals lab. It is fully student scheduling software. The main focus of this project is to encorporate all concepts we have been learning in the class. This includes FSM, singleton, interfaces/abstract, linkedlist, arraylist, etc. This is a group project so code is commented by who wrote/editted it. The GUI is also provided in the outline.
